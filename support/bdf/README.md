# How to use

Copy the *ciaa-acc* folder to *<VIVADO_INSTALL_DIR>/data/boards/board_files/*.

If you don't want to install the board files, you can use `presets.tcl` instead:
* Select `xc7z030fbg676-2` as the FPGA part of the project.
* *Re-Customize* (double click) the Zynq IP.
* Select *Presets* -> *Apply configurations...*
* Browse and select `presets.tcl`
